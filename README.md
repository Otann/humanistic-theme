# README

I am migrating from intellij-based products to VS Code,
so I am trying to make it much more easy on the eyes and visually organised.

## Thoughts and goals

- There is no evidence that dark theme is easier on the eyes
- Reduce UX invasiveness
  - Decrease contrast between UI elements, like toolbars, dropdowns, etc
  - Reduce hovering interactions, so UI don't blink like christmas tree

## TODO:

- [ ] Complete all settings
  - [ ] Lists and menus
- [ ] Publish the theme

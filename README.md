# README

I am migrating from intellij-based products to VS Code,
so I am trying to make it much more easy on the eyes and visually organised.

## Thoughts and goals

- There is no evidence that dark theme is easier on the eyes
- Reduce UX invasiveness
  - Decrease contrast between UI elements, like toolbars, dropdowns, etc
  - Reduce hovering interactions, so UI don't blink like christmas tree

Color theme, inspired by Mac OS and Intellij

- panel text color 090909
- panel background FFFFFF
- panel selected active (accent) 1974C2
- panel selected DFDFDF
- tab active strip 3982CC

- toolbar background F2F2F2
- toolbar border D4D4D4
- editor current line FCFAEE
- editor guides E6E6E6
